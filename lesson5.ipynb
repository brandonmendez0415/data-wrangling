    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will scrape a news webpage to today's headlines. We will then use those headlines to analyze the sentiment in today's news.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Webscraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we have been exclusively dealing with readily accessible and easily digestable data. Through either downloading or API access, we have recieved data. However, sometimes data will exist soley on the face, or HTML text, of a website. This moduele will teach you about how to scrape data off of that webpage.  Make a beware statement: some websites actively try to keep you from scraping, some consistently change so your program might work today but not tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping is a tool employed to extract large amounts of data from websites. The data is extracted and saved to a local file or program on your computer or to a database or table.\n",
    "\n",
    "While webs browsers offer the ability to view most websites, they do not offer the additional functionality to save a copy of the data from these websites. The only option is to manually copy and paste the data, a very tedious task which can take up to days to complete. Web Scraping enables the automation of this proccess, so instead of manually copying the data from websites, the scraping program will have the same result in a fraction of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some webpages will actively try to prevent you from scraping them. So not every webpage can be scraped. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Beware!** A lot of webpages constantly change the structure of their HTML, so while your webscraping program may work today, due to a change in the webpage, it might not work tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    " Before begining this moduele we will provide context on the important libraries and skills below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **HTML Structure** is how a web page is layed out. There is a heirarchy of sections, often referred to as 'Div', that outline how a webpage is layed out. Most of these 'Div' will have a given class or id that can be used to identify that given section.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "  - **Google Chrome's Inspect Feature** allows developers to see a webpage's HTML structure. When on a webpage opened through Google Chrome, right click your mouse and click 'Inspect'. A tool kit on the right side of your browser will open. Ensure that the Elements' is selected on the top tab of the inspection kit. Use this to view the HTML structure of your page. For further help refer to https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/dom/.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **BeautifulSoup** is a Python library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. In order to import BeautifulSoup you will first need to `pip install beautifulsoup4`. Then run the cell below to import the package.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Requests** is a Python library that allows developers make HTTP requests to webpages. In order to import requests, `pip install requests==2.7.0`. Then import requests as we have done in previous modueles. For further help refer to https://pypi.org/project/requests/2.7.0/.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **TextBlob** is a Python library for processing text. It will be the API we use to analyze text for its sentiment analysis. To install `pip install -U textblob`. Then import requests as we have done in previous modueles. For further help refer to https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "On top of requests and textblob, please import numpy and matplotlib as we have done in previous modueles."
